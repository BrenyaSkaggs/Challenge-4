# Overview 

Maria is responsible for cleaning and reviewing data on performance trends. To help Maria we are going to review fifteen different type of schools that have a combined student count of 39,170. We will focus one school, Thomas High School that has a total student count of 1,635. We will remove the 9th grade class and compare the average reading and math scores of the 10th-12th grades to the rest of the data. 



## Results

o	How is the district/school summary affected?
We are removing one grade from Thomas High School (THS)while keeping the rest of the schools as is. The only part of the data that was affected what THS. 

o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The percent for each score went up which would put THS in the top eight schools that have a passing math and passing reading above ninety percent.

o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  -Math and reading scores by grade
    Math and reading scores for the 10th-12th graders increased. 

  -Scores by school spending
   Schools that had a higher spending range(per student) had a lower overall passing percentge compared to the schools that has a lower spending range.

  -Scores by school type
   Smaller schools with 1,000 or less students had the highest overall passing percentage. Aside from that you can see that chartered schools had the highest overall passing p  
   Percentage.

## Summary

Thomas High School performed better after removing the ninth grade scores. Math scores went up by 28% and reading scores went up by 29%. It is hard to compare Thomas High School
to the other schools by removing only 461 students. To get a better comparison on performance trends you would want to remove all of the ninth grade students to see which grade
may be effecting the overall math and reading scores.
